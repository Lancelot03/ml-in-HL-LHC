# ml-in-HL-LHC

The High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) project involves upgrading the LHC to increase its collision rate, which leads to an enormous volume of data. Machine learning (ML) plays a crucial role in handling and analyzing this data to enhance the physics research capabilities of the HL-LHC.

To classify particle collision events using machine learning. This is a typical application where ML helps to distinguish between different types of events, such as background noise versus genuine particle interactions.
