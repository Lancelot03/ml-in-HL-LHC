# ml-in-HL-LHC

The High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) project involves upgrading the LHC to increase its collision rate, which leads to an enormous volume of data. Machine learning (ML) plays a crucial role in handling and analyzing this data to enhance the physics research capabilities of the HL-LHC.

To classify particle collision events using machine learning. This is a typical application where ML helps to distinguish between different types of events, such as background noise versus genuine particle interactions.

For real HL-LHC data, the process involves:

* Data Handling: Using distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark or ROOT for handling large-scale data.
* Feature Engineering: Extracting features from raw data, such as energy deposits in different detector layers, hit positions, and timing information.
* Model Training: Using high-performance computing resources for training more complex models, potentially with GPU acceleration.
* Evaluation and Tuning: Continuously evaluating and tuning models based on new data and feedback from the experiments.
